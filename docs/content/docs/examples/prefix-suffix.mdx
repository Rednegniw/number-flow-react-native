title: Prefix & Suffix
description: Static text before and after animated numbers
full: true
---

The `prefix` and `suffix` props add static text that animates in and out alongside the number. Useful for labels, units, and decorative text.

```LiveExample
import { useState } from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { NumberFlow } from 'number-flow-react-native';
import { ExampleLayout, Button } from './ExampleUI';

export default function GameScore() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  return (
    <ExampleLayout>
      <NumberFlow
        value={score}
        prefix="Score: "
        suffix=" pts"
        style={{ fontSize: 36, fontWeight: '700', color: '#fff' }}
      />
      <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', gap: 8 }}>
        <Button title="+10" onPress={() => setScore(v => v + 10)} />
        <Button title="+100" onPress={() => setScore(v => v + 100)} />
        <Button title="Reset" onPress={() => setScore(0)} />
      </View>
    </ExampleLayout>
  );
}
```

### How it works

- Prefix and suffix characters are treated as static symbols in the layout engine.
- When a prefix or suffix is added or removed (e.g. changing from `""` to `"Score: "`), each character enters with an opacity + vertical slide animation.
- Prefix/suffix characters are keyed independently, so changing from `" pts"` to `" points"` animates only the differing characters.
