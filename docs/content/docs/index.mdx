**Number Flow React Native** is an animated number transition library for React Native. Each digit rolls independently to its target value using virtual digit wheels — columns of digits 0-9 stacked vertically, translated along the Y axis to reveal the correct digit. The library is inspired by [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) for the web, and ships two rendering backends (View-based and Skia) that share a common core.

## Attribution

This library is a React Native reimplementation inspired by [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) by [Maxwell Barvian](https://github.com/barvian). The animation patterns, easing curves, and digit-rolling approach are adapted from the original web implementation. All code in this library is original.
