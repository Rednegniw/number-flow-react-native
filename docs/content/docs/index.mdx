## Overview

Number animation is the sort of effect that makes your product feel great, making it ideal for high quality financial apps, dashboards, and other applications where dynamically changing numbers are displayed.

The library wants to be easy to use, and at the same time be able to handle anything you throw at it - from simple number transitions to complex price tickers, step counters, and more. It's also built to support both View-based and Skia-based rendering backends, as Skia is often used for graphs and charts that require synchronized number animations.

 The library is inspired by [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) for the web, and ships two rendering backends (View-based and Skia) that share a common core.

## Attribution

This library is a React Native reimplementation inspired by [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) by [Maxwell Barvian](https://github.com/barvian). The animation patterns, easing curves, and digit-rolling approach are adapted from the original web implementation. All code in this library is original.
