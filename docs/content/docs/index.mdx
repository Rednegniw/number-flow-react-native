description: Animated number transitions for React Native, inspired by NumberFlow
---

**Number Flow React Native** is an animated number transition library for React Native. Each digit rolls independently to its target value using virtual digit wheels — columns of digits 0-9 stacked vertically, translated along the Y axis to reveal the correct digit. The library is inspired by [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) for the web, and ships two rendering backends (View-based and Skia) that share a common core.

## Features

- Smooth digit-by-digit rolling with automatic direction detection
- Two renderers: View-based (`NumberFlow`, `TimeFlow`) and Skia (`SkiaNumberFlow`, `SkiaTimeFlow`)
- Full `Intl.NumberFormat` support (currencies, percentages, compact, units, locales)
- Scientific and engineering notation with superscript exponents
- `TimeFlow` for animated HH:MM:SS displays (12h/24h, countdown)
- Continuous mode — unchanged lower digits cascade through full rotations
- Worklet-driven scrubbing for zero-latency UI thread updates (Skia)
- Prefix and suffix text with animated enter/exit
- Per-position digit constraints (e.g. minutes tens: 0-5)
- 34 Unicode numeral systems (Arabic-Indic, Devanagari, Thai, CJK, etc.)
- Accessibility support (screen reader labels + announcements)
- Respects device Reduce Motion setting
- Hermes `formatToParts()` compatibility layer
- StrictMode safe

## Native vs Skia

| Feature | Native (View) | Skia (Canvas) |
|---|---|---|
| Extra dependency | None | @shopify/react-native-skia |
| Components | NumberFlow, TimeFlow | SkiaNumberFlow, SkiaTimeFlow |
| Rendering | React Native Animated Views | Skia Canvas |
| Worklet scrubbing | Not available | Yes (`sharedValue` prop) |
| Text styling | `TextStyle` (fontFamily, system fonts) | `SkFont` (requires font file) |
| Gradient mask | MaskedView gradient (optional) or per-digit opacity fallback | Skia LinearGradient + DstIn blending |
| Expo Snack | Full support | Limited (Skia WASM ~3MB) |
| Best for | Standard UI, quick setup | Charts, complex Skia UIs, many instances |

## Attribution

This library is a React Native reimplementation inspired by [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) by [Maxwell Barvian](https://github.com/barvian). The animation patterns, easing curves, and digit-rolling approach are adapted from the original web implementation. All code in this library is original.
