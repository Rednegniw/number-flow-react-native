title: Native vs Skia
description: Choose the right renderer for your use case
---

The library ships two rendering backends that share the same core animation engine. Choose based on your project's needs.

## Comparison

| Feature | Native (View) | Skia (Canvas) |
|---|---|---|
| Extra dependency | None | `@shopify/react-native-skia` |
| Components | `NumberFlow`, `TimeFlow` | `SkiaNumberFlow`, `SkiaTimeFlow` |
| Rendering | React Native Animated Views | Skia Canvas primitives |
| Worklet scrubbing | Not available | Yes (`sharedValue` prop) |
| Text styling | `TextStyle` (fontFamily, system fonts) | `SkFont` (requires font file) |
| Gradient mask | `MaskedView` + View strips | Skia `LinearGradient` + DstIn blending |
| Expo Snack | Full support | Limited (Skia WASM ~3MB) |
| Best for | Standard UI, quick setup | Charts, complex Skia UIs, many instances |

## Choosing a renderer

### When to choose Native

- **Quick setup** — system fonts work out of the box, no font file needed
- **Standard UI** — card layouts, list items, form fields where the number is part of regular React Native views
- **Expo Snack demos** — Skia's WASM bundle is ~3MB, making Snack embeds slow to load
- **Fewer dependencies** — no need to add `@shopify/react-native-skia`

### When to choose Skia

- **Worklet scrubbing** — the `sharedValue` prop enables zero-latency UI thread updates. Essential for gesture-driven UIs, sliders, chart scrubbing, and any interaction where the value changes at 60–120Hz
- **Existing Skia canvases** — if your screen already has a Skia `Canvas` (charts, graphs, custom drawing), render numbers directly alongside other Skia primitives
- **Many simultaneous instances** — a single `Canvas` with multiple `SkiaNumberFlow` components is more efficient than dozens of View-based `NumberFlow` instances
- **Custom font rendering** — when you need exact control over font metrics and glyph rendering

## Using both renderers

### Mixing in the same app

You can use both renderers in the same app. Import from the appropriate entry point:

```tsx
// Native components only (no Skia dependency)
import { NumberFlow, TimeFlow } from 'number-flow-react-native/native';

// Skia components only
import { SkiaNumberFlow, SkiaTimeFlow, useSkiaFont } from 'number-flow-react-native/skia';

// Everything (pulls in Skia as a dependency)
import { NumberFlow, SkiaNumberFlow } from 'number-flow-react-native';
```

<Callout type="info">
If you're not using Skia, import from `number-flow-react-native/native` to avoid pulling in the optional `@shopify/react-native-skia` dependency.
</Callout>

### API differences

The core animation props (`trend`, `animated`, `continuous`, `mask`, `transformTiming`, etc.) are identical across all four components. The differences are in styling and positioning:

| | Native | Skia |
|---|---|---|
| Text appearance | `style` prop (TextStyle) | `font`, `color` props |
| Positioning | CSS layout (flexbox) | Explicit `x`, `y`, `width` |
| Container | `containerStyle` prop (ViewStyle) | Parent `Canvas` |
| Value input | `value` only | `value` or `sharedValue` |
