This library is a complete React Native reimplementation of [NumberFlow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) by Max Barvian. Please check it if you need an animated number component for the web.

The animation patterns, easing curves, and digit-rolling approach are adapted from the original web implementation. All code is original — no source code is shared.
